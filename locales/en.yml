    Tips for effective pitch:

    - Uncomplicated: It should be catchy and roll off the tongue

    - Concise: It shouldnâ€™t take more than a minute to say or read

    - Unique: It reflects your skills, goals, and desires

    - Storyline: It covers who you are, what you offer, and where you want to be

    - Appealing: Your elevator pitch is essentially a persuasive sales pitch; the emphasis should be on what you offer'
